List of changes from baseline code for this project:
•	System.c-added calls for start_client_reqhandler for the server socket functionality and end_client_submission to terminate sockets.
•	Term.c- changed terminal_output to take in int sockfd in order to send back to client. terminal_output function no longer creates terminal.out as per specs and instead sends the sockfd and character pointer to send_client_result function found in process.c. Changed the struct of TermQnode to contain a character array instead of character pointer. Synchronization was achieved with insert_termio and handle_one_termio as both are contained within mutexes in order to achieve mutual exclusion with terminal queue contents. Insert_termio furthermore posts semaq to allow for handle_one_termio to go past the sem_wait(&semaq) found in the while loop of termIO(). start_terminal inits semaq to 0 and mutex to 1 as so handle_one_termio will not loop on an empty queue. End_terminal function posts to &semaq in order to for the thread to exit termIO() to join. 
•	Submit.c was changed in order to accommodate reqhandler’s functions and to initialize sockets. Start_client_reqhandler replaced submission manager initialization called in system.c and creates a thread to manage socket client interface.
•	Process.c was changed for context_out in that CPU register information and execution status as well as process id were saved into the process control block. Furthermore, code was added to added to run the idleprocess by changing it’s execution status in the PCB and context switching in, with an added timer and accommodate execution status change to eReady which would lead to context switching out the idle process. 
•	Cpu.c was changed for handling opcode cases. Appropriate breaks were added.
•	Client.c was altered accordingly to spec to not require the submission of a client id as it is assigned a process id. Client.c no longer continues onto next file name request after one read from the socket as multiple print statements should be read per file. 
•	Simos.h-small changes from original, such as reconciling function names and function parameters. Consolidated new added function names and parameters. PCB structure was altered slightly as sockfd of the client was added.
•	Code from Project 1 was obtained from standard original files. 
•	Issues: This was not in the specifications, just personal observation- client does not terminate with simos.exe. Could be fixed for client.c using threading if I had time to be able to detect server termination and thus automatic client self-termination. Wanted to get rid of the warnings from queue.c (unchanged from the original file).
